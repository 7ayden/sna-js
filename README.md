sna-js
======

This repository contains javascript code that interact with *social network APIs*, generate *D3.js visualizations*, and *calculate relevant metrics* for **social network analysis**. 

You can see it in use at: http://socilab.com. Socilab is a social network utility that allows users to visualize, analyze, and download data on their LinkedIn network.

I am actively developing this as users request more features and look forward to collaborating to anyone who shares an interest in **making network analysis more accessible on the web**.
