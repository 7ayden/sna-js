Features to add to network analysis:

1. Industry diversity index
2. Ordered list of top 5 contacts in eigenvector centrality
3. Add sharing feature for social media integration.

Features to add to visualization:

1. Node sizing by ego's dependence (proportional tie strength or eigenvector centrality of a given node)
2. Coloring by community detection algorithm (detect clusters of contacts with high density - e.g. colleagues at different companies, classmates, friends from civic organization, etc.)
3. Add static sharing feature for social media integration.
