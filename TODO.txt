Features to add to network analysis:

1. Industry diversity index
2. Ordered list of top 5 contacts in eigenvector centrality
3. Add sharing feature for social media integration.
4. Add pdf download feature.
5. Error message once throttled.
6. Format download according to visualization option (connections to self included/excluded).

Features to add to visualization:

1. Node sizing by ego's dependence (proportional tie strength or eigenvector centrality of a given node)
2. Coloring by community detection algorithm (detect clusters of contacts with high density - e.g. colleagues at different companies, classmates, friends from civic organization, etc.)
3. Add static sharing feature for social media integration.
4. Add option to remove names.
